Summarize your results and include any insights or observations.
In summary, we noted that the memory efficient version of the algorithm (as expected) used less memory than the basic implementation of sequence alignment. When we used a memory profiler to get an estimation of the RAM used for both versions, we discovered that the memory efficient version uses anywhere from around 2 to 10 times less memory than the standard version. This was an expected result, as we expected the memory efficient verison to have a memory complexity of O(m+n) while we expected the standard version to have a complexity of O(mn).
We also noted that the memory efficient version of the algorithm ran slower than the basic version by a factor of around two. This was not surprising given that both versions of the algorithm run with the time complexity of O(mn)

F. You also need to state each group members contribution to the project, e.g.coding, testing, report preparation
